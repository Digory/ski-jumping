This is my solution to the final exercise in week 8 of the University of Helsinki's (free) object-oriented programming course. 
See here for more details: https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-8/

The program creates a fictional ski-jumping tournament. Ski-jumping is a sport many Finnish people enjoy; with the aim of jumping 
as far as possible, in the most stylish way. The user is asked for the names of the jumpers and they continue to jump til the user 
decides they have had enough. The score is calculated by adding the length of the jump and the judges' decisions. The greatest 
and least decisions are not taken into account. When the tournament is finished, the results are displayed and the winner is decided.
